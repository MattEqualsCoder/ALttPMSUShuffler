## ALttPMSUShuffler

* Get game file metadata from SpriteSomething to sniff out header name
* For un/patched vanilla game files, see if a crc32 check can be made
* See about including patches (.ips/.bps) in output dir to facilitate MSU usage instead of needing to pre-patch
* See about including manifests of existing packs that have alternate tracks
